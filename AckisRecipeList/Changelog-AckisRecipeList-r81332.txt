- Add 100% dry-coded implemetnation of a text dump.  This will go through your recipe list and display all recipes for a profession, and the information about them in a CSV format.  I will be playing around with this in the future to make it look prettier.
- You can access the text dump by typing /arl and clicking on the text dump button.  Chances are things will blow up however.

- Added comments on what functions to nuke come WotLK
- Added L["MissingFromDBWarning"]
- Mod will now scan for the missing recipe spell ID when doing a scan (scan takes a while to do about 10 seconds for 10 recipes) so warning added just so users know what's going on.
- Added first Enchanting recipes from wrath
- Added a wrath alchemy recipe just to see if it worked and it had a cool sounding name haha :P
- Version updated, looks like it works 100% in wrath right now.  Go me?
