description:
Displays a flashing on-screen-effect and plays a sound when you gain Shadow Trance or Backlash. Also notifies you when you are low on health or mana or when you create a Soul Shard, with a visual effect.

usage:
"/wa config" brings up the config menu

Notes:
*Atm, if you don't want to use any of the InGame-sounds, you have to place a sound file in the \Interface\AddOns\WarlockAlert\Sounds folder, and name it either ShadowTrance.mp3 or Backlash.mp3 (depending on which effect the sound is for)
*Check the list in "sounds.txt" for InGame-sound. Be sure to copy the name exactly, otherwise they might not work.
*The textures used in this addon are either blizzards own textures, made by me or taken from "http://www.wowtextures.com/".
*If you are the author of one of the textures let me know and i will give you the credit for it or, if you do not want me to use it, remove/replace it.
