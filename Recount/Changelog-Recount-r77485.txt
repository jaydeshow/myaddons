Recount:
- SPELL_PERIODIC_DAMAGE spellName will now have a (DoT) appended. This allows to disambiguate between moonfire direct and dot damage. It also means that pure dot will have the suffix attached because in the combat log they look the same as mixed damage spells eventwise.
- Made delay of GroupCheck on entry longer so that players are correctly recognized as being in their own group.
