README for the extended features in Politewhisper Extended:

If upgrading from the non extended version of PoliteWhisper and the whispers do not seem to work,
hit Reset in the Custom Whispers tab.


Custom whisper tags
-------------------

You can now customize the whispers sent. Tbe following tags work:

$P = name of target player being whispered
$L = level of target player being whispered
$C = class of target player being whispered
$D = name of destination zone/instance
$R = desired role of whispered player in group, eg. tank, healer, dps, offtank etc
$N = number of players in group
$B = name of group leader
$G = group makeup (classes and levels)

The tags will be replaced when the whisper is sent, so if you have a whisper in PoliteWhisper that looks like this

	"Hello, $P, want to join a group for $D?"

then the resulting whisper would be something like this:

	"Hello, Shen, want to join a group for Auchindoun - Shadow Labyrinth?"
