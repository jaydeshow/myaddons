- Update Petrify skill to zero the tank's threat (Chaos Gazer, Sunwell Plateau).
- Fix an error from occurring if the player uses Sunder Armor while mind controlled.

Threat-2.0: Fix paladin healing threat

As pointed out by Zappster[1], paladin healing threat has been broken
since 2.4.2.  Since the general belief[2] seems to be that all healing
by a paladin---even that caused by other classes and hence spell
schools---is affected, we introduce a new modifier for healing and
have paladins set it to 0.25.

Extensively discussed with Xinhuan, kalahassi and nevcairiel.

Threat-2.0: Publish Paladin threat immediately after Righteous Defense

We publish on the first event after an RD debuff series.  Note that
unlike with Taunt/Growl, other debuffs can actually break the chain,
but this is a minor problem: it just triggers an additional comm
message.

Threat-2.0: Do not set the 'force' flag in Taunt publishes

That flag overrides the check whether the last published threat is
still accurate, and is not needed.

Threat-2.0: Move lastPublishTime update to PublishTime()

Mainly so that the forced publishes I am spreading around are counted
towards the publish interval code.

Threat-2.0: Detect Growl/Taunt misses quickly, use this to publish right after

Note that this change depends on the fact (empirically shown in logs
since late March) that a Taunt resist is always of the form

  SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS,...,355,"Taunt",0x1
  SPELL_MISSED,...,355,"Taunt",0x1,RESIST

with no events in between.  We exploit this to detect a successful
Taunt on the event directly following the cast, and publish threat
immediately.  This should improve accuracy with Taunts in quick
succession.
