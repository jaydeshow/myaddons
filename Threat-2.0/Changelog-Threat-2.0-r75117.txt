Threat-2.0: Remove Mind Control from list of spells to track (priest), so it doesn't cause errors. To this date, the amount of threat caused by Mind Control is unknown, and seems to be proportional to the HP of the target mob in Bryne's theory (Elitist Jerks forums).

Threat-2.0: Nil out threat to dead mobs even if it is 0, rather than only if it is greater than 0. Hopefully fixes lingering threat issues (and avoid calculating healing threat on dead mobs). No blacklist involved.

This changes the CLEU handling to a function-table-driven approach,

Threat-2.0:
- Remove threat handler for Lightning Capacitor. It deals full threat from the damage, not half.
- Cleanup half the Shaman module to apply Elemental Precision on all Nature/Fire/Frost spells rather than just specific shaman damage spells. This mainly affects The Lightning Capacitor proc and nature healing spells.
