Threat-2.0: Remove Mind Control from list of spells to track (priest), so it doesn't cause errors. To this date, the amount of threat caused by Mind Control is unknown, and seems to be proportional to the HP of the target mob in Bryne's theory (Elitist Jerks forums).

Threat-2.0: Nil out threat to dead mobs even if it is 0, rather than only if it is greater than 0. Hopefully fixes lingering threat issues (and avoid calculating healing threat on dead mobs). No blacklist involved.

Threat-2.0: Get rid of lingering threat on dead mobs by blacklisting them as they die. This improves healing threat and dead corpses will no longer show lingering threat from players with this threat revision.
