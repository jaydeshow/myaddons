BunchOfBars:
- Fix the problem with the VisualHeal bar not aligning properly with the health bar at all times. This was caused by the update function no longer being hooked on the health bar update function, which means that the health bar update function is not guaranteed to run before the VisualHeal bar update function.

BunchOfBars:
- Get rid of LibBabble-Spell-3.0 (not used anymore by BoB). With very little work Babble-Spell-2.2 can be pruned as well, as only DogTag-1.0 has it as an optional dependency and it is only used directly for a few simple look-ups that can now be replaced by GetSpellInfo easily.
