- Add 100% dry-coded implemetnation of a text dump.  This will go through your recipe list and display all recipes for a profession, and the information about them in a CSV format.  I will be playing around with this in the future to make it look prettier.
- You can access the text dump by typing /arl and clicking on the text dump button.  Chances are things will blow up however.

AckisRecipeList:
- Added sorting functionality for non-gui mode
- Removed the reseting of variables from the main command function and moved it to when the window closes.  This should let you scan the trade skill multiple times

AckisRecipeList:
- GUI coming along, can parse recipes (no filter yet), but it shows the recipe names
- I think I may have introduced a bug on displaying recipes, if you notice the number of missing recipes being different than what are displayed please let me know. Please. (ie: Says you know 172 out of 178, and are missing 6 recipes, however only displays 5 recipes without a filter on).
- GUI scrollbar doesn't show up/work at all
- Pie > Cake
