AckisRecipeList:

	L["Scan Recipes"]
	L["Scans an open tradeskill for missing recipes."]
	L["Text Dump"]
	L["Displays all recipes in a comma seperated value format which can be copied and pasted into another client."]
- Add 100% dry-coded implemetnation of a text dump.  This will go through your recipe list and display all recipes for a profession, and the information about them in a CSV format.  I will be playing around with this in the future to make it look prettier.
- You can access the text dump by typing /arl and clicking on the text dump button.  Chances are things will blow up however.
- Removed enGB as Ace3 just does enUS == enGB
- New framework for ruRU and esMX
- Version update
- Dry-coded (compiles with luac -p)
