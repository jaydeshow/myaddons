Addon:  Condensed SpellBook
Author: LBXZero
Version: 1.02

Details:

It has been requested a few times to Blizzard to make a less cluttered spell book.  Unfortunately Blizzard may never do so until someone else makes a succesful one.  In turn during the spare time I had in the last week, I took the original spell book and modified it.

Version 1.0:

Name changed to Condensed SpellBook from SpellBook Lite, but kept naming conventions.  Condensed SpellBook fully mimics every function of the original spell book while only listing each unique spell only once and having lower ranks available.

Version 1.01a:

Fixed the minor bugs that slipped through the cracks.

Version 1.02:

Reworked the code for more optimized performance.  The main frame of the spellbook is more optimized than the original spellbook, reducing redundancy and event calls made.
