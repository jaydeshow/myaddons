Threat-2.0: Another attempt to fix Vanish on Veras Darkshadow (Illidari Council). His vanish buff doesn't reliably fade all the time I think, so we use his Vanish spell cast instead.

Threat-2.0: Fix Lifebloom threat

Testing by Xinhuan[1] proves that LB HOT only adds half threat
compared to other heals, and the Bloom effect does not result in any
threat for either the druid or the target.

Threat-2.0: Fix Paladin holy spell IDs

r70263 changed Paladin holy spell IDs to match those in SPELL_HEAL
events, which were different from the ones on spell buttons.  Starting
with 2.4.2, they have been back to the "real" spell IDs again for HL
and FoL, and were changed again for Holy Shock.  Pointed out by
Zappster[1].

This resurrects the old RFC patch that was dropped in favour of the
flat (but apparently wrong) modifier in r78939.

Threat-2.0: Revert "Fix paladin healing threat"

Zappster points out [1] that the modifier does not apply to at least
PoM; so we revert this change.  A patch to fix the spell IDs follows.

Threat-2.0: Fix Veras Darkshadow's Vanish spell ID from 41479 to 41476, so that, you know, his threat actually vanishes when he casts vanish.
