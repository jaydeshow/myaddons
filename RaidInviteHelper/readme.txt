ABOUT:

This addon will automatically invite people to your party and
then convert it to a raid and keep inviting.  You can set
what keyword people use by doing:

    /rih keyword something

Where "something" is what you want people to type.  You can turn
the addon on and off with:

    /rih enabled

...

FUTURE:

* automatically invite online raid members (by guild rank, list?)
* configurable max size of group/raid so it won't grow too far

...

Happy sailing.
